This code computes a dominator tree from a directed graph. Dominator
trees are widely used in control flow graphs, such as are found in
compiler optimization passes.

The algorithm used is Lengauer-Tarjan, based on the paper "A Fast 
Algorithm for Finding Dominators in a Flowgraph", Thomas Lengauer 
and Robert Tarjan, 1979.
